        <p id="content">"Hey, I'm Killua Zoldyck. Yeah, from that Zoldyck family —<br> the infamous assassins. I was trained to kill since I could walk, <br> and trust me, I’m good at it. But honestly, I’m kinda over it.<br> I’m not just some weapon for hire anymore.
            I’d rather hang out<br> with my friends, like Gon, and explore the world on my own terms.<br> Freedom feels way better than being stuck in the shadow of my family’s <br> reputation. Oh, and you should know, I’ve got a sweet tooth<br> — chocolate
            and anything sugary is the way to my heart.<br> But don’t mistake that for weakness. Mess with me or<br> the people I care about, and, well, let's just say I’ve got a few tricks<br> up my sleeve... including some that are way deadlier than
            you’d expect.<br> I may look like a kid, but I can take care of myself.<br> So yeah, that’s me — Killua. Just trying to live life, enjoy the ride, <br> and maybe fry a few bad guys with my lightning <br> powers if they push me too far." <br>
